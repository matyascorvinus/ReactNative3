## Practice 2 - Sorting an Array

Write a function `sort` that accept 1 parameter `input`:

```javascript
function sort(input){
  // Your code here
}
```

The data parameter will accept objects in the form of:

```javascript
{
  "input" : [
    /*
     * An unsorted array containing integer numbers ranging from -10000 to 10000.
     */
  ]
}
```

Example piece of data:

```javascript
{
  "input" : [8662, 7484, -4488, 99, -3625, -5847, 1162, 3950, 205]
}
```

The objective of this practice is to write a `sort(input)` function that return an ascending-sorted version of the input array. For the example above, your function should return `[-5847, -4488, -3625, 99, 205, 1162, 3950, 7484, 8662]`.

As with the previous practice, you are not allowed to use the built-in function provided in example, and must write your own algorithm that solve this particular problem.

After you're done submit the folder to your git repository for evaluation.
